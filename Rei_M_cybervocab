one day i woke up and i had about 40 emails in my inbox. so i archive what i dont want and scroll through a newsletter
then i open a track my page, the usual. i got a unusual email from one of my social media accounts. they told me that 
they would be calling me later in the evening so i thought what could go wrong. so they called me teling me that there 
was some suspicious activity on my account and they needed my email and password. they seemed pretty legit so i gave them
my information. as soon as i gave them my information they hung up. they were on my email sending emails so they could install 
a mallware into my laptop and get ahold of my bank account information and of all my passwords and they were taking money out of 
my bank. they ended up giving the money back and gave my passwords back. i emailed the hacker and asked him why he said beacause 
he just wanted my account to "make it safe" so now i know not to give my inforamation to anyone unless they show me their 
resources
